# FlikIsDining Bot
a simple discord bot that shows you what's for lunch using the flikisdining api. This is a private bot for my friends and I, but feel free to use it for your own server.

## Commands
If inside of the primary channel (see the .env) the bot will respond to messages with `what` and `lunch`. Otherwise, must have `what lunch` continously in the message.

this means you can have fun and be like `yooyoyoyo what is the lunch for today??` and it'll respond. 

You can also add `tmr` or `tomorrow` to see the lunch for tomorrow, and this can be chained. So `tmr tmr` will show the lunch for the day after tomorrow.

## notice
this isn't meant to be a public bot, so it's not very user friendly. this is also one of my first projects in Rust, so there's probably a lot of bad code.
